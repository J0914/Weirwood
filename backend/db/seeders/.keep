It is located in the Vale of Arryn near the east coast of Westeros. The Eyrie straddles the top of a peak in the Mountains of the Moon several thousand feet above the valley floor below. It is approached by a narrow causeway and road. Those who would approach the Eyrie must pass through three way-castles guarding the ascent - and then, must proceed in single file, making them very vulnerable to archers. For these reasons, the Eyrie is considered impregnable to any attack that does not involve dragons, and its defenses have never been overcome.

Sure, one man's rubble is another's fixer-upper, but Harrenhal has a reputation for its lords meeting particularly grisly ends. The castle reportedly became cursed after its ruler and his sons were burned alive in one of the towers by Aegon the Conqueror's dragon; every house to hold the hall since has likewise gone extinct. This castle is abandoned, so you'll have all the privacy you require!", price: 1000, createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() }
